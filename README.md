## 📋 Project Information

**Project Name:** Automated Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition

**Project Abstract:**

An intelligent attendance management system that leverages facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking in educational institutions and corporate environments. The system addresses critical issues of manual attendance methods including proxy attendance, buddy punching, and administrative inefficiencies. Built with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend, the platform provides dual interfaces for administrators and employees. Admins can register employees, train facial recognition models, and access comprehensive attendance reports with filtering capabilities, while employees can mark attendance through facial verification and view personal records. The system uses the face_recognition library built on dlib's state-of-the-art algorithms for accurate facial detection, encoding, and matching. By eliminating manual processes, the solution ensures authentic identity verification, provides real-time analytics, reduces administrative overhead, and supports digital transformation in attendance management.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Manual attendance tracking enables fraud and consumes resources, necessitating intelligent biometric automation. Traditional attendance systems in educational and corporate settings suffer from proxy marking, administrative burden, and lack of real-time insights for tracking engagement patterns.

## 💡 Solution Overview

Our automated facial recognition system verifies employee identity in real-time, eliminating proxy attendance and buddy punching completely. The platform automates employee registration, model training, attendance capture, and report generation—built with Next.js, FastAPI, and face_recognition algorithms. This solution removes manual processing, provides instant verification and real-time reporting, significantly reducing administrative workload while ensuring attendance accuracy.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer** - Next.js frontend with responsive interfaces
2. **Business Logic Layer** - FastAPI backend handling API requests and facial recognition processing
3. **Data Layer** - SQL database for persistent storage of employee and attendance data

**Facial Recognition Pipeline:**
- Face detection and enrollment during registration
- Facial encoding generation (128-dimensional vectors)
- Model training with employee dataset
- Real-time face matching and verification
- Automatic attendance logging with timestamps
